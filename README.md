#### what I have completed:

* all Psets

* required reading in Syllabus

#### comments:

I have not watched all the lecture vidios for I have some basic knowledge about computer programming and Python. I think this is a good introductory course for students who is first time to learn computer science. But knowledge in this course maybe not suitable for students with background knowledge about computer programming because the knowledge is familiar and easy for them.
