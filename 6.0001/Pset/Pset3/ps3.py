    lowercase letters, so you will have to handle uppercase and mixed case strings 
    appropriately.

	The first component is the sum of the points for letters in the word.
	The second component is the larger of:

            7*wordlen - 3*(n-wordlen), where wordlen is the length of the word
            and n is the hand length when the word was played

	Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is
	worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
