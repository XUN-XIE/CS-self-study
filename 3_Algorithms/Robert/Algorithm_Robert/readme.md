This is the my code for studying Algorithms 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne. The original code in book is written by JAVA, but I wrote it by C++ for I am studying C++ and I have not learned JAVA. (There are still some code completed by JAVA because the first Chapter of this book is used for learning JAVA)


What I have completed:

1. Chapter1 - Chapter3, JAVA basics, Sort algorithms, Searching Algorithms with corresponding data structures(tree and hash table)

2. The Exercises after each section, but there are still some I cannot finish for its difficulty.


the booksite for the book: [https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/]


The remaing part of the book is

Chapter4 : Graph

Chapter5 : String

Chapter6 : other advanced data structure or algorithm


I have met some obscure knowledge when I study Graph algorithm, so I will learn it after I learn some theory of graph in discrete mathematics.
